# PRO-C119-OBJECT-DETECTION-AND-TRACKING
In Class 119, you learned to track the object in the video. In this project, you’ll do the same by tracking the ball object in the video.
John and his friends were playing foot volleyball. John’s friend recorded a video of them playing together. 
John wanted to see how long they were able to keep the ball in the play, so he decided to create a tracking tool that will track the ball in the video.
Can you help John in creating the ball tracking tool?
